## Analysis

- Load packages and data

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| code-line-numbers: 1,2,3,4|5,6,7
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
lemurs <- read_csv(
  "lemur_data.csv",
  col_types = cols_only(sex = "c", age_at_wt_mo = "d", weight_g = "d"))
```

## Plot

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-cap: "Age vs weight of lemurs"
#| fig-alt: "Scatter plot of age vs weight of lemurs, split by male and female showing positive relationship for both"
ggplot(data = lemurs,
       mapping = aes(x = age_at_wt_mo,
                     y = weight_g,
                     colour = sex)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Weight of lemurs",
       x = "Age (months)",
       y = "Weight (g)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Average weight

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
mean(lemurs$weight_g)
```
