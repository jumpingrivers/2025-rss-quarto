# Dynamic Presentations with Quarto

Materials for the "Dynamic Presentations with Quarto" workshop given by Myles at the RSS International Conference 2025.

Workshop length: 80 minutes

## Contents

Open the index.html file in the browser to view the workshop slides. These are also available at [bit.ly/2025-rss-quarto](https://bit.ly/2025-rss-quarto).

The scripts/ folder contains the solutions to the tasks, along with example R code and an example styling extension (which you can use by setting the YAML `format` field to `jrSlides-revealjs`).

## Dependencies

Quarto comes bundled with RStudio IDE v2022.07.1 or later. So if you've already got RStudio, you've probably already got Quarto!

For other IDEs, follow the instructions in the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) to get started.
